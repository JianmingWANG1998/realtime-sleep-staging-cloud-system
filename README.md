# Real-Time-Sleep-Staging-Cloud-System
## Description
This project is about deploying a Django framework in the Alibaba cloud with some sleep staging machine learning algorithms in order to achieve an online real-time prediction system.

## Programming Environment
* Development Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 in Alibaba Cloud (Specific Service Information)
* Programming Language: Python3.8
* Framework: Django (reference website linke:)
* Required Packages: (requirement.txt)

## Prediction Model 
* Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) based on the polysomnography data sampled by micro needles (data augmentation)
* Baseline Model 

## Work Plan
